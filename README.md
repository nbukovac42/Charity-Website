# Charity-Website
We wanted to create a website that makes it easier and relatively faster for someone to donate to charities.
Our website offers a list of 10 foundations that we researched and made sure were great selections and great choices for our user to put money into. 
To make it easier for the user all of the charity links bring them straight to the donation process. 
We display all of the needed information for each charity so that our users make the right charity choice and feel as if their money is going to help make a difference. 
We also added a web search bar at the end of our website incase our users don’t find any charities that interest them. 
Another feature we added to our website is before a user leaves our site after they donate
they can save the name and any other information that they would like, so when they return they will 
be greeted with a “You donated to this charity last”. We thought this feature would be a nice touch so if 
users find a charity that they really like and they don’t wanna forget what its called they can save that 
information in the form bar.

# user-story

As a user who is wanting to donate to a charity
I don’t want to browse the web endlessly just to find MAYBE a decent charity to donate to. 
I want a process that makes it quicker and easier.
Thus in return could possibly help these foundations raise more money as with our website it would make the donation process easier.  (Hypothetically)

# Overall

Overall this project was great to create. It offered some great practice with using API's and to just build something with a slightly larger scale.

For future development it would be nice to slowly add more and more charities to our list of 10 currently. It would be nice to give our users a decent selection.
